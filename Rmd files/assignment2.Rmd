```

1. The data set `UN11` in the `alr4` package contains several variables, including `ppgdp`, the gross national product per person in U.S. dollars, and `fertility`, the birth rate per 1000 females, from the year 2009. The data are for 199 localities, and we will study the regression of `fertility` on `ppgdp`.

  (a) Identify the predictor and response.  

        **Solution**:
        The predictor is ppgdp, and the response is fertility.

        ![](1x1.png){width=0%} <!-- increase width to also increase empty space below solution marker -->

  (b) Draw the scatterplot of fertility against ppgdp and describe the relationship between these two variables. Is the trend linear?  

        **Solution**:
        The trend is not linear, it appears to be negatively exponential. As         fertility increases, ppgdp decreases dramatically.

```{r fig.height = 3 , fig.width= 4}
ggplot(UN11, aes(ppgdp, fertility)) + geom_point()
```
        
   
  (c) Replace both variables by their natural logarithms and draw another scatterplot. Does the simple linear regression model seem plausible for a summary of this graph?  

        **Solution**:
        The simple linear regression model definitely seems more plausible,
        as taking the natural log of each variable resulyts in a more linear
        relationship with a clearer slope and intercept.
        
      
```{r fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(UN11, aes(log(ppgdp),log(fertility))) + geom_point()
```


2. The data set `prostate` in the `faraway` package is from a study of 97 men with prostate cancer. Interest is in predicting `lpsa` (log prostate specific antigen) with `lcavol` (log cancer volume). You may not use the function `lm` for this question.

  (a) Draw a scatterplot - does a simple linear regression model seem reasonable?  

        **Solution**: 
        A simple linear regression model seems reasonable; there is a clear positive linear relationship
```{r fig.height = 3.5 , fig.width = 4.5}
data("prostate", package = "faraway")
View(prostate)
ggplot(prostate, aes(lcavol, lpsa)) + geom_point() 
```
        

  ![](1x1.png){width=0%} <!-- increase width to also increase empty space below solution marker -->

  (b) Compute the values $\bar{x}, \bar{y}, S_{xx}, S_{yy}$ and $S_{xy}$. Compute the ordinary least squares estimates of the intercept and slope for the simple linear regression model, and draw the fitted line on your plot from part a).  

        **Solution:**  
```{r fig.height= 3, fig.width = 4}
xbar = mean(prostate$lcavol)
ybar = mean(prostate$lpsa)
sxx = sum((prostate$lcavol - xbar)**2)
syy = sum((prostate$lpsa - ybar)**2)
sxy = sum((prostate$lcavol - xbar)*(prostate$lpsa - ybar))

OLS_b1 = sxy/sxx
OLS_b0 = ybar - OLS_b1*xbar

ggplot(prostate, aes(lcavol, lpsa)) + geom_point()+ geom_abline(aes(intercept=OLS_b0, slope = OLS_b1))

```

       

  (c) Compute $\hat{\sigma}^{2}$ and find the estimated standard errors of $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$. Also find the estimated covariance between $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$.  

        **Solution:** 
        Note that E($\hat{\sigma}^{2}$)  =  ${\sigma}^{2}$ 
```{r}
error = prostate$lpsa - (OLS_b0 +OLS_b1*prostate$lcavol)
RSS = sum(error**2)
sigma2hat = (1/nrow(prostate)-2)*RSS

se_b0 = sigma2hat*((1/nrow(prostate))+(xbar**2/sxx))
se_b1 = sigma2hat/sxx
covb0b1 = ((-xbar*sigma2hat)/sxx)
```
       
        

  (d) Carry out $t$-tests for the two null hypotheses $\beta_{0}=0$ and $\beta_{1}=0$, reporting the value of the test statistic and a $p$-value in each case.  

        **Solution:**
        In both cases, where $\beta_{0}=0$ and $\beta_{1}=0$, as seen in the model, the p-values are the same at 2.2e-16. 
```{r}
model_prostate <- lm(lpsa~lcavol, prostate)
summary(model_prostate)
```


3. The data set `ftcollinstemp` in the `alr4` package gives the mean temperature in the fall of each year, defined as September 1 to November 30 , and the mean temperature in the following winter, defined as December 1 to the end of February in the following calendar year, in degrees Fahrenheit, for Ft. Collins, CO (Colorado Climate Center, 2012). These data cover the time period from 1900 to 2010 . The question of interest is: Does the average fall temperature predict the average winter temperature?

  (a) Use the `lm` function in $\mathrm{R}$ to fit the regression of the response on the predictor. Draw a scatterplot of the data and add your fitted regression line.  

        **Solution:**  
```{r}
data("ftcollinstemp", package = 'alr4')
temp_lm <- lm(winter ~ fall, ftcollinstemp)
summary(temp_lm)
ggplot(ftcollinstemp, aes(fall, winter)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)


```
        


  (b) Test the null hypothesis that the slope is 0 against a two-sided alternative at $\alpha=0.01$, and interpret your findings.  

        **Solution:** 
        The $p$-value corresponding to $\beta_1$, or the change in rate of winter temperatures as fall temperatures increase, is 0.0428. At $\alpha=0.01$, this value is not significant, so we fail reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 0, which implies that fall temperatures are not a significant predictor of winter temperatures.
```{r}

```

        ![](1x1.png){width=0%} <!-- increase width to also increase empty space below solution marker -->

  (c) What percentage of the variability in winter is explained by fall?  

        **Solution:** 
        The $R^2$ value given by the model is 0.0371, which implies that approximately 3.7% of the variability in winter temperatures is explained by fall temperatures.
